  "overview": "This demo presents an intelligent multi-agent system designed for automating First Notice of Loss (FNOL), claims processing, and real-time status inquiries within the insurance industry. It simulates a scalable and secure AI-driven claims handling pipeline that integrates contextual understanding, sentiment tracking, and proactive resolution, reducing human dependency and operational delays",
  "business": "The demo targets Tier-1 telecom customer support, reducing average resolution time by 60%, enhancing customer satisfaction, and enabling real-time sentiment tracking and intelligent escalation, all without human intervention.",
  "approach": "The solution leverages LangGraph for orchestrating agent workflows, Faiss for semantic search via RAG, and Neo4j for contextual knowledge graph storage. Each agent interacts indirectly through contextual memory, ensuring modularity and traceability.",
  "SolutionComponents": [
    "Intent Detection Agent",
    "Troubleshooting Agent",
    "Escalation Agent",
    "Supervisor Agent",
    "Neo4j Knowledge Graph",
    "Vector Store with RAG (Faiss)",
    "Contextual Memory Store",
    "LangGraph Execution Engine"
  ],
  "architecture_image": "https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*G-ycW5HQEwMnJ9V8sR4seA.png",
  "dataflow": "User queries flow into the Intent Detection Agent, which determines the required response or escalation. Data is enriched via the contextual memory, using Faiss for RAG and Neo4j for past resolutions. Agents collaboratively process and update the memory before responding.",
  "design": "Each agent follows a state-based execution triggered by events using LangGraph. They are containerized for scalability and interact with tools (e.g., vector DB, KG, APIs) indirectly. Failures are tracked using a supervisor agent with fallback mechanisms.",
