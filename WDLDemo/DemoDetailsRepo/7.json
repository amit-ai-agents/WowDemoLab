  "demoID": "Retail_FootfallHeatmap",
  "UseCaseTitle": "Real-Time Retail Footfall & Heatmap Analytics",
  "Purpose": "To visualize store traffic and customer movement in real-time using live camera feeds, enabling retailers to optimize store layout, staffing, and promotional strategies.",
  "ExecSummary": "Brick-and-mortar retailers often lack insights into in-store customer behavior, leading to inefficient layouts and missed sales opportunities. This live footfall heatmap agent leverages computer vision to capture movement patterns and inform real-time operational and strategic decisions.",
  "ExecSummaryKeyAsks": [
    "Capture customer footfall in real-time",
    "Generate intuitive heatmaps for store zones",
    "Use data to optimize staffing and layouts",
    "Integrate analytics seamlessly with existing store systems"
  ],
  "BusinessObjectives": [
    "Improve in-store shopper experience through layout optimization",
    "Increase conversion rates by placing staff strategically",
    "Reduce operational waste and queue delays",
    "Make data-driven decisions on promotions and store planning"
  ],
  "BusinessBenefits": [
    "15-25% lift in conversion from better traffic flow",
    "Optimize staffing schedules to match peak hours",
    "Reduce time customers spend in queues by 20%",
    "Enable evidence-based merchandising and campaign planning"
  ],
  "overview": "This demo showcases a live computer vision AI system that processes camera feeds to detect people, track movement patterns, and render real-time footfall heatmaps. Built on Python, OpenCV, and Flask, it offers visual analytics for store operations.",
  "business": "Retailers need deeper insights into how customers move through physical spaces to improve layout, restocking, promotions, and staffing. Manual observation is inconsistent and not scalable.",
  "approach": "The system ingests video feed from in-store cameras, runs real-time detection and tracking via OpenCV models, and aggregates positional data into heatmap layers. Insights are served through a Flask-based dashboard.",
  "BusinessDrivers": [
    "Need for smarter, data-driven store operations",
    "Visualize high-traffic zones and bottlenecks",
    "Reduce lost sales from understaffing or stockouts",
    "Support agile store reconfiguration based on real data"
  ],
  "BusinessChallanges": [
    "Limited visibility into physical customer behaviors",
    "Inadequate manual methods for aisle or zone optimization",
    "Difficulty adapting staff allocation in real-time",
    "No easy integration between vision analytics and operations"
  ],
  "FunctionalOverview": [
    "Footfall Detection: Detects and counts people in camera frames.",
    "Zone Tracking: Monitors customer movement across predefined store zones.",
    "Heatmap Generation: Aggregates traffic density into visual heatmaps.",
    "Analytics Dashboard: Displays metrics, trends, and zone insights.",
    "Alerting: Identifies unusually high footfall or queue build-ups."
