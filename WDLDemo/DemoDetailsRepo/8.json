  "UseCaseTitle": "AI Agent for Optimizing Healthcare Patient Flow",
  "Purpose": "To streamline and optimize patient movement across hospital departments, ensuring efficient utilization of resources and enhancing the patient care journey.",
  "ExecSummary": "Hospitals often struggle with delays in patient transfers, departmental bottlenecks, and inefficient utilization of critical care resources. This solution uses AI agents and a real-time knowledge graph to manage and optimize patient flow dynamically across departments, improving both patient experience and operational outcomes.",
  "ExecSummaryKeyAsks": [
    "Track and predict patient flow across hospital departments",
    "Detect resource bottlenecks in real-time",
    "Improve coordination between emergency, inpatient, and diagnostic teams",
    "Ensure optimal use of beds, equipment, and personnel"
  ],
  "BusinessObjectives": [
    "Reduce patient wait times and delays in care transitions",
    "Increase hospital throughput without additional staffing",
    "Enable real-time, intelligent decision-making for patient routing",
    "Improve staff coordination and communication"
  ],
  "BusinessBenefits": [
    "15-20% faster patient throughput",
    "25% improvement in bed utilization efficiency",
    "Reduction in emergency department overcrowding",
    "Better care continuity and reduced patient dissatisfaction"
  ],
  "overview": "This demo illustrates a real-time AI-based orchestration platform that models and optimizes patient movement across a healthcare facility using multi-agent systems, contextual awareness, and graph-driven insights.",
  "business": "Healthcare operations often suffer from manual coordination, siloed departments, and data latency. Inefficient patient flow contributes to longer stays, delayed discharges, and staff burnout. This use case introduces an intelligent layer that dynamically coordinates patient routing based on real-time resource availability.",
  "approach": "The system uses React and Flask for interface and orchestration, and Neo4j to maintain a dynamic graph of patient journeys, departmental capacities, and equipment availability. Autonomous agents analyze context and optimize decisions across various hospital functions.",
  "BusinessDrivers": [
    "Improve hospital operational efficiency",
    "Reduce emergency room overcrowding",
    "Enable real-time situational awareness",
    "Enhance staff communication and role-based task allocation",
    "Support data-driven, predictive planning"
  ],
  "BusinessChallanges": [
    "Manual patient coordination across departments",
    "No centralized view of bed and equipment availability",
    "Reactive instead of proactive patient movement decisions",
    "Communication silos between departments",
    "Inability to scale during surges (e.g., pandemics)"
  ],
  "FunctionalOverview": [
    "Real-time Patient Tracking: Live view of patient location, movement, and care status",
    "Flow Optimization Engine: AI-based logic that prioritizes patient transitions",
    "Departmental Coordination: Automatic alerts and task routing to staff",

  "dataflow": "Patient admission triggers flow initiation via the Patient Flow Agent. Real-time data is pushed to the Neo4j graph and visualized on the dashboard. Capacity and Alert Agents monitor thresholds and push alerts or rerouting instructions as needed. Staff actions update the graph to maintain state consistency.",
  "design": "Each agent follows a state-driven execution model with asynchronous triggers. Flask provides API middleware, and Neo4j ensures high-performance graph operations. React dashboards consume and visualize insights for human-in-the-loop interaction. All components are containerized and scalable.",
