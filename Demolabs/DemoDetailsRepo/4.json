  "demoID": "AIAgent_TelecomEscalation",
  "UseCaseTitle": "AI Agent for Real-Time Escalation Management in Telecom Support",
  "Purpose": "To detect customer frustration in real time from voice or text interactions and automatically escalate critical conversations to human supervisors, improving satisfaction and retention.",
  "ExecSummary": "Telecom providers face increasing pressure to enhance customer satisfaction while managing large volumes of support interactions. Delayed escalations and missed frustration signals lead to churn and poor brand perception. This agentic AI system enables real-time detection of customer distress and automatic routing to human supervisors—reducing churn and improving resolution quality.",
  "ExecSummaryKeyAsks": [
    "Detect customer frustration proactively",
    "Automate escalation to supervisor in real time",
    "Reduce agent workload and response lag",
    "Improve NPS and retention in telecom customer care"
  ],
  "BusinessObjectives": [
    "Enhance customer experience by timely intervention during negative interactions",
    "Reduce dependency on manual monitoring or rule-based escalation",
    "Lower churn by improving support responsiveness",
    "Boost operational efficiency by filtering high-priority sessions intelligently"
  ],
  "BusinessBenefits": [
    "20–30% Reduction in customer complaints related to unresolved queries",
    "15% improvement in Net Promoter Score (NPS)",
    "Increased retention through proactive support",
    "Reduction in supervisor response lag by 70%"
  ],
  "overview": "This demo showcases a real-time escalation management system powered by agentic AI. It uses sentiment detection and lightweight LLMs to continuously monitor conversations for distress signals. When detected, the system escalates the session context to a human supervisor agent with minimal latency.",
  "business": "Customer service in telecom is under constant strain due to high interaction volume, pressure for 24/7 responsiveness, and sensitivity to customer churn. Escalations often happen too late due to lag in human detection. Automating escalation workflows improves both efficiency and user satisfaction.",
  "approach": "The architecture leverages LangGraph to orchestrate multiple agents, DistilBERT or Phi-2 for lightweight and efficient sentiment analysis, and Flask for service integration. The supervisor agent operates asynchronously and is triggered by the escalation agent based on real-time emotion tracking.",
  "BusinessDrivers": [
    "Deliver proactive and responsive telecom support",
    "Use AI to monitor and detect high-risk interactions in real time",
    "Eliminate missed escalation opportunities",
    "Enable consistent, data-driven supervisor handoffs"
  ],
  "BusinessChallanges": [
    "High costs due to human-only escalation monitoring",
    "Delayed escalation during peak interaction periods",
    "Inconsistent service quality in handling frustrated customers",
    "High agent attrition due to overload from unresolved complex cases"

  "FunctionalOverview": [
    "Real-time Sentiment Detection: Monitor customer tone continuously in chat/voice",
    "Escalation Triggering: Route session to a Supervisor Agent when frustration is detected",
    "Agent Feedback Loop: Tracks agent performance post-escalation for learning",
    "Lightweight Deployment: Optimized for on-premise or hybrid contact center environments"

  "dataflow": "User interaction flows through the Sentiment Detection Agent, which uses DistilBERT/Phi-2 to classify emotional tone. If the frustration threshold is crossed, it triggers the Escalation Agent to route the session to a human supervisor with session memory. The Supervisor Agent receives the full context and joins the live session or responds accordingly.",
  "design": "Agents operate in a LangGraph state machine. Each interaction is stored in contextual memory and annotated with emotional scores. Flask endpoints serve as bridges to real-time supervisor dashboards. All agents are modular and containerized for scalable deployment.",
