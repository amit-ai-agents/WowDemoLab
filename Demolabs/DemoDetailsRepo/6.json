  "demoID": "SmartCityAgent_DashboardOps",
  "UseCaseTitle": "Autonomous AI Dashboard for Smart City Operations",
  "Purpose": "To provide city administrators with real-time, actionable insights across infrastructure, traffic, environment, and utilities through a unified AI-powered dashboard.",
  "ExecSummary": "Modern cities are increasingly equipped with IoT sensors across infrastructure, but struggle to consolidate and derive meaningful insights from siloed data. A real-time Smart City Dashboard powered by intelligent agents enables proactive governance, efficient operations, and citizen-centric services.",
  "ExecSummaryKeyAsks": [
    "Consolidate city-wide data from various IoT systems",
    "Enable real-time monitoring and anomaly detection",
    "Visualize KPIs and trends across operations",
    "Support decision-making for city planners and response teams"
  ],
  "BusinessObjectives": [
    "Optimize city operations across traffic, utilities, and safety",
    "Increase situational awareness for emergency response",
    "Enable data-driven urban planning",
    "Enhance public satisfaction through transparency and responsiveness"
  ],
  "BusinessBenefits": [
    "25-40% increase in operational efficiency",
    "Faster response times to city incidents or anomalies",
    "Improved coordination across departments (utilities, transport, environment)",
    "Data transparency fostering public trust"
  ],
  "overview": "This solution presents an agent-powered smart city dashboard that unifies data from diverse sensors and city services. Built using Node.js, MongoDB, and ECharts, it enables real-time visualization, AI-based pattern recognition, and operational alerts for smarter governance.",
  "business": "Governments worldwide are investing in smart infrastructure, but often lack a centralized command center that provides real-time oversight. This leads to delayed responses, fragmented decision-making, and underutilized IoT data streams.",
  "approach": "Data is ingested from traffic cameras, weather stations, utility meters, and public service endpoints. Intelligent agents process and normalize this data, detect anomalies, and update the dashboard UI in real-time. MongoDB acts as the time-series store, and ECharts renders interactive visualizations.",
  "BusinessDrivers": [
    "Real-time oversight of city infrastructure",
    "Early detection of outages, congestion, or anomalies",
    "Unified platform for public safety and operations",
    "Operational coordination across government departments",
    "Data-driven urban development"
  ],
  "BusinessChallanges": [
    "Fragmented sensor data formats and protocols",
    "Lack of real-time situational intelligence",
    "Manual correlation of events across departments",
    "Difficulty in forecasting resource demands",
    "Absence of citizen-facing transparency tools"
  ],
  "FunctionalOverview": [
    "Real-Time Data Aggregation: Collects live data feeds from various municipal systems.",
    "KPI Visualization: Renders metrics on energy usage, air quality, traffic congestion, water distribution, etc.",
    "Anomaly Detection: AI-based logic triggers alerts for anomalies or threshold breaches.",
    "Drill-down Insights: Stakeholders can explore granular data across zones and service categories.",
    "Cross-Agency Coordination: Shared dashboard access ensures collaborative resolution and planning."
